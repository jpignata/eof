"*I desperately wish that all those who choose Mozilla as an employer could stay as long as interest and skills connect.*"

&mdash; Mozilla CEO [Mitchell Baker](https://twitter.com/MitchellBaker?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) in an [internal memo](https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Message-to-Employees-Change-in-Difficult-Times.pdf) announcing a reduction of ~250 employees, and warning the leftovers if that connection wanes they'll be next.

"*There's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles out, and I think we have the president to do it.*"

&mdash; Majorie Taylor Greene, [winner of a house Republican primary in Georgia last week](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/08/12/republicans-are-becoming-qanon-party/), in a [2017 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rtYok4fdbQ) discussing QAnon.

### recap

[Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/), the non-profit remnants of the once-mighty Netscape Communications Corporation, announced last week that  they are restructuring by [reducing staff and cutting projects](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/). Their business model of relying on the firehose of Google's advertising revenue for their browser's default search traffic is no longer adequately funding their expenses. Citing Covid-19 and a "changing world," the memo promises renewed focus on product, technology, community, and economics, and doesn't mention that they've been [complacent for the last decade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox#/media/File:Firefox_mascot_-_FISL_16.jpg) while Google Chrome obviated their raison d'être while providing a revenue stream completely disconnected from products and customers. Firefox currently holds marketshare of less than 5% and dropping. Reportedly, [Google and Mozilla have extended their search deal through 2023](https://www.zdnet.com/article/sources-mozilla-extends-its-google-search-deal/), so the life support will continue until that number glides to zero and Verizon Media acquires whatever's left for their [internet brand boneyard](https://www.verizonmedia.com/our-brands).

In 2007, Steve Jobs announced Apple had [a very sweet solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKKISOnOCaw&feature=youtu.be&t=29) for developers who wanted to build third-party apps for iPhone: "*you can write amazing Web 2.0 and AJAX apps that look exactly and behave exactly like apps*." Crickets chirped in the typically rowdy hometown WWDC crowd. A year later Apple shipped SDKs and the App Store, giving developers access to an entirely new modality of computing and customers a trustworthy source for applications after a decade of spyware and toolbars and Windows XP. Apple had low expectations for its commercial success with Jobs himself saying, "*we don't expect this to be a big profit generator.*" Smash cut to 2020. Last year the App Store generated $50 billion in gross revenue. On Friday, Epic Games orchestrated a public relations coup by intentionally violating App Store rules in pushing an update which discounted Fortnite in-game currency if purchased directly from Epic. Apple yanked Fortnite from the App Store, and Epic immediately responded with a [lawsuit](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/apple-complaint-734589783.pdf) and released a video, [Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiSHuaw6Q4), a parody of the [Ridley Scott "1984" Macintosh ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I). Epic is attempting to weaponize their audience against Apple and while they've taken the freedom-fighter position, ultimately their goal is their own parallel stores on iOS and Android so they can shave their own middleman percentage from other developers. Both companies' arguments have merit, and there's no clear very sweet solution here, so you just have to ask yourself: are you on the side of the billion-dollar company, or the trillion-dollar company?

'Of course,' Vaynerchuk responded, visibly distraught by the question. 'But I don’t think I'm manipulative.'*"

[The Languages Which Almost Became CSS](https://eager.io/blog/the-languages-which-almost-were-css/) [Eager] &mdash; "*So then I get to tell people, 'Well, you get to learn this language to write your document, and then you get to learn that language for actually making your document look like you want it to.' Oh, they'll love that.*" &mdash; Marc Andreessen in 1994

[Belle Delphine Went From Selling Bath Water to an OnlyFans Subscription](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7kpxjx/belle-delphine-influencer-onlyfans) [Vice] &mdash; Squarely in the lowbrow/despicable quadrant, but, this statistic stands out: "*since the COVID-19 pandemic began, OnlyFans is one company that benefited directly from people needing new sources of income during unprecedented unemployment—and turning to selling their own content. In May, at the peak of the pandemic lockdown in New York, the platform reported gaining 150,000 new users every 24 hours.*"

Chuckles reverberated through the crowd.*"

But we went ahead and did the shoot and put Tony through the paces. He busted his ass off giving us all kinds of different tricks. It was fantastic to look at it on the computer and use it for reference, but it was way too late for us to get that data into that game.*"

[QAnon Was a Theory on a Message Board. Now It’s Headed to Congress.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/15/opinion/qanon-marjorie-greene-congress.html) [NYTimes] &mdash; "*The stewards of the Big Tech platforms surely didn’t envision QAnon when they sought to connect the world. But they should have. Because the movement leveraged all the platforms’ tools exactly as they were intended to be used. 'When you bring people together, you never know where it will lead,' Mr. Zuckerberg said in 2017. He was right.*"

[United States of Conspiracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjL5rUx3TM) [PBS Frontline] &mdash; Alex Jones, purveyor of the now-deplatformed [InfoWars](https://www.infowars.com/) and "*the examplar of a conspiracy entrepreneur*" was a force in the 2016 election by tickling the nightmarish-new-world-government centers of the gullible. This Frontline documentary explores his humble beginnings on Austin radio and making [VHS tapes of conspiracy imagery hilariously scored to O Fortuna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp76DVFAysA), to helping elect a president by congealing his dude radio audience around Donald Trump, to ultimately being yanked from his distribution channels over his trademark super-gross Sandy Hook conspiracy theories &mdash; amongst other infractions. He rode the algorithms to influence and fame, and without their boost he is back where he started: relegated to the fringes. Pretty indicting of this technological terror we've constructed.
