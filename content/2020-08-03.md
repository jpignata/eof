*"... a billion dollars... of money? For a thing that kind of ruins your pictures?"*

&mdash; Jon Stewart, commenting on Facebook's acquisition of Instagram on *The Daily Show with Jon Stewart*, in a 2012 [episode](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/q44wd5/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-the-social-networth) which also covered the launch of [Google Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvTrx-i_nB4).

*"Cyber criminals will not find sanctuary behind their keyboards."*

&mdash; John F. Bennett, special agent in charge of the San Francisco division of the FBI, in the dope-on-the-table [Department of Justice press release](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/three-individuals-charged-alleged-roles-twitter-hack) announcing charges in the recent Twitter hack. Easy there, big fella.

### recap

[Three young men have been charged](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/technology/twitter-hack-arrest.html) in the 15 July systems compromise of Twitter ultimately used for an ill-conceived, hail-mary cryptocurrency scam. The perpetrators allegedly used accounts with massive followings such as [Barack Obama](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J7TJ6XakbAWNCaKbG0MyqSekpBg=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20086116/Screen_Shot_2020_07_15_at_2.35.49_PM.png), [Apple](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUimC-zE1_QL3jZ1dIVcqpHKtzI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20086035/Screen_Shot_2020_07_15_at_1.59.40_PM.png), and [Kanye West](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UC_SB34j64eRjoVPgu-qbgismTU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20086046/Screen_Shot_2020_07_15_at_2.04.53_PM.png) to send tweets promising bitcoin sent to a specific address would be doubled and returned to the sender. Thanks to the profile of the accounts used and the size of the audience, this clear scam still netted ~$117K in hundreds of transactions, but also guaranteed the arrest of those responsible. Two weeks later, [a 17-year old is in custody in Florida](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/07/three-charged-in-july-15-twitter-compromise/) and is being styled a mastermind and "not an ordinary 17-year old" by prosecutors. One of the perpetrators was using a Coinbase account verified by their own identify, and all of their diabolic planning was mediated by Discord, who responded to the incoming subpoena posthaste with incriminating chatlogs. As reported by the [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/technology/twitter-hackers-interview.html) and [Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/07/whos-behind-wednesdays-epic-twitter-hack/) days after the incident, this scheme was perpetrated by kids whose social capital is scored by their access to and inventory of "og" social media handles. So &mdash; perhaps an ordinary 17-year old with too much free time and an undeveloped sense of the consequences of his actions. He and his playmates will face them and perhaps he'll go onto a [security consulting career](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBZwFFTQUoU). Twitter though faces no apparent consequences for negligence despite their demonstrated underinvestment in the safety of the information under their stewardship.

Last Wednesday, the heads of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google (or Alphabet, I guess?), took their medicine in front of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee during a hearing titled *[Online Platforms and Market Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBFDQvIrWYM)*. In several rounds of questioning, a panel of fifteen congresspeople were given five minutes each to gnash their teeth and ask questions whose answers they'd sharply cut off as to "reclaim their time." While this approach mostly didn't yield any new information, some congresspeople did get [a clip of themselves to share online](https://twitter.com/Jim_Jordan/status/1288531314166190080) out of it. More interesting than the hearing itself, [the documents released by the committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/online-platforms-and-market-power/) from their trove of 1.1 million documents of source material outline the theory of the case: these four companies own the routes to market and eliminate competition. On balance, the Democrats' questions were concerned with consumer harm, anti-competitive behavior, and power over distribution, while the Republicans were mainly upset about Donald Trump Jr.'s Twitter account suspension, cancel culture, and their parents not getting their campaign emails in their Gmail inbox. It was theatre, and while it was made plain each member is massively pissed off at big technology companies, the reasons why are varied, the intended audiences for their ire are different, and the appetite for government intervention and regulation is dictated by the typical party lines.

Covid-19 has cleared the tech convention calendar through early 2021. Last week AWS announced they are scrubbing their annual re:Invent, typically a week-long 65K attendee event in Las Vegas, opting instead for a [virtual incarnation](https://twitter.com/jeffbarr/status/1288544794856235009) like [Microsoft Build](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21163586/microsoft-build-2020-virtual-event-cancel-online-coronavirus) and [WWDC](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/03/13/wwdc-2020-online) before it. Worse for Las Vegas, CES, an annual event where 150K plus people arrive through LAS to see the latest in 5G AI lightbulbs or whatever, was also [cancelled and moved online](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/07/ces-2021-in-las-vegas-is-cancelled-event-moves-online/). We won't see hordes paying thousands of dollars for a boxed lunch and the privilege of being sold things anytime soon.

A network of bots is scanning for open instances of Elasticsearch and MongoDB and expunging them. The attackers are not leaving ransom notes demanding cryptocurrency but simply overwriting databases and indices with empty instances named [meow](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/07/more-than-1000-databases-have-been-nuked-by-mystery-meow-attack/). Insecure defaults by incompetent vendors implemented by inexperienced developers all with a wanton disregard for customers' data privacy &mdash; so, just another day in the bit mines. As of this morning, [tens of thousands of databases appear impacted](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=meow). [@MayhemDayOne](https://twitter.com/MayhemDayOne) was the security researcher to discover this bot and has been sharing updates.

NASA is doing things again! Last Thursday, [they hurled a 200-foot Atlas V rocket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIB3JbIIbPU&feature=youtu.be&t=2913) carrying the car-sized [Perseverance rover](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/) and Ingenuity helicopter to Mars. In February, these will land and [explore for one Mars year](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/timeline/surface-operations/) (or two of your Earth years) looking for signs of microbial life in the ancient past. Yesterday astronauts [Bob Behnken](https://twitter.com/AstroBehnken) and [Doug Hurley](https://twitter.com/Astro_Doug) ended their 63-day stay on the International Space Station and rode SpaceX's [Dragon 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2) spacecraft to a [splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico](https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1289996815824117760).

[A Massive Leak of Nintendo Source Code Is Causing Chaos in Video Games](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7kp7bx/a-massive-leak-of-nintendo-source-code-is-causing-chaos-in-video-games) [Vice] &mdash; "*On a Discord channel, I watched in real-time as hundreds of fans picked apart the files, trying to sort what was new, what was old, and what would send fans into a tizzy. The phrase 'holy shit' was uttered often enough that it eventually became meaningless. Every few minutes, people would find something revelatory, like the word 'fuck' snuck into the source code of Link to the Past, or confirmation that Luigi was, in fact, meant to be part of Super Mario 64.*"

[Google’s Top Search Result? Surprise! It’s Google](https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/07/28/google-search-results-prioritize-google-products-over-competitors) [The Markup] &mdash; "*In Google’s early years, users would type in a query and get back a page of 10 'blue links' that led to different websites. 'We want to get you out of Google and to the right place as fast as possible,' co-founder Larry Page said in 2004. Today, Google often considers that 'right place' to be Google.*"

[Philosophers On GPT-3](http://dailynous.com/2020/07/30/philosophers-gpt-3/) [Daily Nous] &mdash; "*Today’s Twitter bots and customer service autochats are primitive harbingers of conversational simulacra that will be useful, and then ubiquitous, precisely because they deploy their statistical magic to blend in among real online humans. It won’t really matter whether these prolix digital fluidities could pass an unrestricted Turing Test, because our daily interactions with them will be just like our daily interactions with most online humans: brief, task-specific, transactional. So long as we get what we came for then we won’t bother testing whether our interlocutor is a fellow human or an all-electronic statistical parrot.*"

[Why America Is Afraid of TikTok](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/07/tiktok-ban-china-america/614725/) [The Atlantic] &mdash; "*The fact is, no matter where he located his servers, how many American hotshots he recruited, or how he organized his managers, Zhang couldn’t single-handedly rebuild America’s trust in China, and that, in the end, was his real problem.*"

[Reply All #165 &mdash; The Mold and the Beautiful](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/6nhw5w/165-the-mold-and-the-beautiful) &mdash; In a segment where a single tweet is explored in an attempt to arrive at something in the neighborhood of comprehension, the hosts and Jason Mantzoukas dissect a QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theory related to child trafficking, Wayfair dot com, and conspicuously priced industrial cabinetry.

[The Speed Cubers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wrTIWx_Z6k) &mdash; In the spirit of other documentaries about competitors engaging in deeply unmodish hobbies (see also [The King of Kong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2ObjxcV7EY)), this short documentary introduces two champion speed solvers of the Rubik's Cube. It's fairly feelgoody and it's mesmerizing to watch these kids' solve. Then, peek down the [related YouTube hole](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cubing).

[Computer Chronicles](https://www.twitch.tv/computerchronicles) &mdash; From the early 80's until 2002, PBS ran a weekly show covering the personal computer revolution. A few years ago it was placed into the public domain and made available via the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/computerchronicles). Now somebody is streaming it via Twitch, and it's very watchable.
