- Like everybody else, most of my week was spent sitting around jitterily watching the news. As if karmic punishment for
  all of the [empty celebration][Death to 2020] for the end of 2020, the year has begun inauspiciously. This week [4,000
  people died from Covid-19 in a single day][Data in Motion: 1/8] while rioters [stormed the Capitol] fueled by a potent
  cocktail of personal dissatisfaction and virulent misinformation. The [last stream] of [Ashli Babbitt][shooting] is
  short and haunting &mdash; specifically the moment where she beams with pride at having seen the President speak.
  We're all drained, nursing an emotional hangover, and there are harder weeks still ahead.

- I finished [Devs] which glacially unfolded to an unsatisfying ending. Kind of a slog to get through, but it did look
  beautiful. The languishing pace, underdeveloped core premise, and poor performances leave more on the negative side of
  the sheet than the positive but that said it's still probably worth your time. [Alison Pill] continues her involvement
  in projects for which I get excited that turn out to be mostly bad.  (See also: [Star Trek: Picard], [The Newsroom]).
  I enjoyed [The Incomparable] episode covering it (cleverly titled [ASMR From Hell]) more than the show itself.

- The final episodes of *Jeopardy!* hosted by [Alex Trebek] finished airing on Friday. Things change constantly in media
  and now there's so goddamned much of it who even notices. *Jeopardy!* was different; a fixture from 1984 onward with
  Trebek at the lectern. He seemed to aim to be mostly invisible as host, barely concealing his mildly pompous and
  standoffish nature, and with intermittent displays of kindness, enthusiasm, and [joie de vivre][tribute]. He continued
  hosting the show until ten days prior to his death; quietly doing the job he loved with dignity and grace. We should
  all be so lucky.

- Through some kind of sinister corporate interplay [HBO Max is now available on Roku]. As an [AT&T
  customer][commercial][^0] I believe I am contractually obligated to watch it, so I have been. [Wonder Woman 1984]
  landed with a [thud][review] on Christmas Day, and I've tried to watch it a few times but it makes me drowsy. Buried a
  few screens beneath that blockbuster noise, HBO Max quietly has the best movie catalog of the streaming services. This
  week I started to introduce my kids to [Studio Ghibli] by way of [My Neighbor Totoro]. They humored me and responded
  with a mixture of mild interest and confusion. Next: [Porco Rosso]. 

- I stumbled onto a [Numberphile video] on YouTube about [Pascal's triangle] and started tinkering in my [notebook
  repo]. Like the elementary cellular automata I mentioned last week, this structure also has something like the
  SierpiÅ„ski triangle encoded within it. Using [`comb`][comb] to generate the triangle, and coloring in the cells with
  odd numbers, you get a jaggedy version of it.

  ```python
  from math import comb
  from sys import argv

  def draw(size):
    for i in range(size):
        row = [comb(i, j) % 2 for j in range(i + 1)]
        print(''.join('.' if c else ' ' for c in row).center(size))

  if len(argv) > 1:
      draw(int(argv[1]))
  ```

  ```plaintext
  $ python pascal.py 15
          .
         ..
         . .
        ....
        .   .
       ..  ..
       . . . .
      ........
      .       .
     ..      ..
     . .     . .
    ....    ....
    .   .   .   .
   ..  ..  ..  ..
   . . . . . . . .
  ................
  ```

  Fun.

- I didn't get very much reading done this week, but finished a couple of books and started [The Twenty-Six Words That
  Created The Internet] which is about the history and impact of [Section 230] of the Communications Decency Act.

- The folks at [Red Letter Media] released a two part re:View of [Twin Peaks: The Return]. While I hadn't thought much
  about this show since it ran a few years ago, this recap highlighted that while it was mostly nonsense, it was highly
  enjoyable, artful nonsense.
