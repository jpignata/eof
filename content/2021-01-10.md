- Like yours, most of my week was spent sitting around jitterily watching the news. As if karmic punishment for all of the
  [empty celebration][Death to 2020] for the end of 2020, the year has begun inauspiciously. This week [4,000
  people died from Covid-19 in a single day][Data in Motion: 1/8] while rioters [stormed the Capitol] fueled by a potent
  mix of personal dissatisfaction and virulent misinformation. The [last stream] of [Ashli Babbitt][shooting] is short
  and hauting &mdash; specifically the moment where she beams with pride at having seen the President speak. We're all
  drained, nursing an emotional hungover, and there are harder weeks still ahead.

- I finished [Devs] which unfolded with the unsatisfying ending it glacially was building toward. It was kind
  of a slog to get through, but it did look beautiful. The languishing pace, underdeveloped core premise, and poor
  performances leave more on the negative side of the sheet than the positive but that said it's probably worth your
  time.  [Alison Pill] continues to be involved in projects for which I get excited that turn out to be mostly bad. (See
  also: [Star Trek: Picard], [The Newsroom]). I enjoyed [The Incomparable] episode covering it cleverly titled [ASMR
  From Hell] more than the show itself.

- The final episodes of *Jeopardy!* hosted by [Alex Trebek] finished airing on Friday. Things change daily in media and
  now there's so goddamned much of it who even notices. *Jeopardy!* was different; a fixture from 1984 onward with
  Trebek at the helm. He seemed to aim to be mostly invisible as host, barely hiding his mildly pompous and standoffish
  nature, but with intermittent displays of kindness, enthusiasm, and [joie de vivre][tribute]. He continued hosting the
  show until ten days prior to his death; quietly doing the job he loved with dignity and grace. We should all be so
  lucky.

- Through some kind of sinister corporate interplay [HBO Max is now available on Roku]. As an [AT&T
  customer][commercial][^0], I believe am contractally obligated to watch it so I have been. [Wonder Woman 1984], the
  first of [Warner Media's concurrent streaming/theatre releases][variety], landed with a [thud][review] on Christmas
  Day. I've tried to watch it a few times but it makes me drowsy. Buried a few screens beneath that noise, HBO Max has
  the best movie catalog the streaming services. This week I started to introduce my kids to [Studio Ghibli] by way of
  [My Neighbor Totoro]; they humored me and responded with a mixture of mild interest and confusion. Next: [Porco
  Rosso]. 

- Stumbled onto a Numberphile video on YouTube about [Pascal's Triangle] and started tinkering in my [notebook
  repo]. Like the elementary cellular automata I mentioned last week, this structure also has the Sierpenski Triangle
  encoded within it!

[^0]: It's really delightful to see corporate strategy unintentionally dragged in a company's advertising campaigns.
