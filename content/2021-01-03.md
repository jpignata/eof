- Happy [2021]! üçæü•Ç

- So, hi. I've resolved to keep weeknotes this year. I can't say exactly why other than because the internet exists and
  we should use it to publish things. I'm looking forward to having a reason to open `vim` and write inconsequential
  things for basically nobody to read like it's 1997.

- [Advent of Code] was a lovely way to begin each day throughout December. [The creator][ericwastl] not only crafts
  really fun challenges but also writes whimsical bits of story and creates a piece of holiday themed [ASCII art] that's
  incrementally revealed as you solve each day. While ostensibly a time-based contest that begins each night at midnight
  EST, all of that jazz is entirely optional. That said, it's worth a glance at some of the competitive programming
  oriented participants who solve these puzzles [astonishingly quickly][screencast]. My solutions, which are less
  interesting and much clumsier, are on [GitHub][adventofcode repo].

- AoC 2020 featured three separate [cellular automata] puzzles ([11][day11], [17][day17], [24][day24]) presumably in
  rememberance of [John Conway] who [passed away in April][obituary] after contracting Covid-19. The 50th anniversary of
  the discovery of Conway's [Game of Life] was last October and his [biographer] marked the occasion this week in a
  [small piece in the NYTimes][article] featuring reflections from his contemporaries. After reading the above and
  thumbing through [A New Kind of Science], I started tinkering with matplotlib to draw elementary cellular automata and
  added it to my [notebook] (my lowbrow version of [pytudes]).
