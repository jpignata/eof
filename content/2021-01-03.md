- Happy [2021]! üçæü•Ç

- So, hi. I've resolved to keep weeknotes this year. I can't say exactly why other than because the internet exists and
  we should use it to publish things. I'm looking forward to having a reason to open `vim` and write inconsequential
  things for basically nobody to read like it's 1997.

- [Advent of Code] was a lovely way to begin each day throughout December. [The creator][ericwastl] not only crafts
  really fun challenges but also writes whimsical bits of story and creates a piece of holiday themed [ASCII art] that's
  incrementally revealed as you solve each day. While ostensibly a time-based contest that begins each night at midnight
  EST, all of that jazz is entirely optional. That said, it's worth a glance at some of the competitive programming
  oriented participants who solve these puzzles [astonishingly quickly][screencast]. My solutions, which are less
  interesting and much clumsier, are on [GitHub][adventofcode repo].

- AoC 2020 featured three separate [cellular automata] puzzles ([11][day11], [17][day17], [24][day24]) presumably in
  rememberance of [John Conway] who [passed away in April][obituary] after contracting Covid-19. The 50th anniversary of
  the discovery of Conway's [Game of Life] was last October and his [biographer] marked the occasion this week in a
  [small piece in the NYTimes][article] featuring reflections from his contemporaries. After reading the above and
  thumbing through [A New Kind of Science], I tinkered with matplotlib to draw elementary cellular automata and added it
  to my [notebook] (my lowbrow version of [pytudes]).

- I started watching *[Devs]* and am finding it needlessly bleak and self-serious, disinterested in its central premise,
  and performed by actors who can't seem bothered to make a convincing go of it. On the plus side, it sure does look
  pretty.  Some of the world building and character development is fun like the bit about engineers ping-ponging the
  Fibonnaci sequence for sport &mdash; both charming and obnoxious. I found the first couple episodes pretty promising
  but it quickly seemed to lose the thread of story it was telling.

- The only other shows I watched this week are from the pablum hose called CBS All Access: *[The Stand]* and *[Star
  Trek: Discovery]*. In defense of *The Stand*, neither the [source material][stand book] or [first mini-series] could
  be correctly described as "good" so it's on course for par. I read/watched and enjoyed both, so I'll stick with it.
  *Discovery*, like all new *Star Trek*, remains rubbish. I'll stick with that also due to similar circumstances.

- This week I've been reading *[The Joy of x]*, *[A Promised Land]*, and *[The Fifth Season]*; &ldquo;[Anthony Weiner‚Äôs
  Comeback Gig]&rdquo; is a small piece from this week's *The New Yorker* in *The Talk of the Town* telling of Weiner's
  new gig running a countertop factory in the Naval yard with sentences like, &ldquo;*In Congress, Weiner was an
  exacting boss, known for throwing salads and BlackBerrys.*&rdquo;

- *[The Daily]* revisited some of their more popular episodes from this year last week. &ldquo;[Genie Chance and the
  Great Alaska Earthquake]&rdquo; tells the story of a housewife-cum-broadcaster who helmed the mic at an Anchorage
  radio station for 24 hours after a 9.2 magnitude earthquake ripped the city apart in 1964. I'm a sucker for a story
  involving radio and this one was quite good.
