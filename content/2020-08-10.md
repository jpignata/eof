"*The internet is not a friendly place. Things that don’t stay relevant don’t even get the luxury of leaving ruins. They disappear.*"

&mdash; [Reportedly excerpted](https://onezero.medium.com/the-inside-story-of-how-facebook-acquired-instagram-318f244f1283) from a version of the Facebook new hire handbook. Weird paranoid grandiosity but ok.

"*Yeah, my critique of dance moves will be fantastically value-added for them.*"

&mdash; Bill Gates, in a [Wired interview](https://www.wired.com/story/bill-gates-on-covid-most-us-tests-are-completely-garbage/), deflecting questions about Microsoft's bid to acquire TikTok with wry boomer bemusement.

### recap

Apple continues to [light developer goodwill on fire](https://twitter.com/Alticus/status/1274710153141653504). Last week, two other tech giants took to the media to pout over App Store policies in the aftermath of the [hay over Hey](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/opinion/apple-app-store-hey.html). Microsoft announced that they are ending the [Project xCloud](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-streaming/project-xcloud) preview on iOS as they "*do not have a path to bring our vision of cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to gamers on iOS via the Apple ‌App Store‌.*" Read: "*Waah! Apple won't let us ship our thing!*" On Thursday, Apple [released a statement confirming their App Store doesn't permit streaming gaming apps](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-explains-why-xbox-game-pass-is-not-on-iphone-2020-8). Facebook joined the fray announcing its [Facebook Gaming](https://www.facebook.com/fbgaminghome) app is now in the App Store, but taking a moment to [slam Apple over their unwillingness to approve it with game play features](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/technology/facebook-apple-gaming-app-store.html). Bad look for Apple in sharper relief given [Tim Cook's recent participation in a Congressional Antitrust hearing](https://daringfireball.net/2020/07/parsing_cooks_opening_statement), and the grumbling from both users and developers who are losing patience with Apple's iron-fisted control of the platform. Though, [as Apple continually reminds us](https://youtu.be/H6eYLCxxQdA?t=135), without their App Store developers would be burning CD-ROMs, shrink-wrapping boxes, and negotiating with Staples or OfficeMax or whatever for endcap placements. There is just no other alternative for software distribution so shut up about it already please!

The bulk of "tech news" last week was driven by the proposed ban of TikTok in the United States, though it's unclear if anything has actually happened thanks to the Trump administration's penchant for ambiguity. To wit: the State Department on Wednesday announced their ["Clean Network" initiative](https://www.state.gov/announcing-the-expansion-of-the-clean-network-to-safeguard-americas-assets/) which, while not doing anything directly, gestures toward eliminating any telecommunications, technology, or information infrastructure that cause American bits to contact Chinese Community Party-influenced companies. The next day, the White House released a pair of executive orders taking action against [TenCent](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-wechat/) (owner of WeChat) and [ByteDance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-tiktok/) (owner of TikTok), prohibiting transactions with these companies in 45 days. Nobody knows exactly how that will work, so the media are [wildly speculating](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/8/21358941/wechat-ban-apple-china-business-trump-tariffs-trade-manufacturing-impact) scenarios including Apple being forced to remove WeChat (or Weixin) from their Chinese App Store, torpedoing future iPhone sales in China. Meanwhile, by [staffing the photocopiers around the clock](https://live.staticflickr.com/2385/1895583251_f102d4324d_z.jpg), Facebook has released [Instagram Reels](https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-instagram-reels-announcement/) just in time to shelter potentially displaced influencers and the traffic and ad revenue in their orbit. Microsoft loudly, and with deference to Dear Leader, [is working toward acquiring some or all of TikTok](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/08/02/microsoft-to-continue-discussions-on-potential-tiktok-purchase-in-the-united-states/), which is baffling given [recent expensive failures](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features) outside of their enterprise software lane. Twitter is [reportedly also in the mix](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tiktok-m-a-twitter-idUSKCN2540ZG). This all reduces down to "something is going to happen but nobody knows what!" &mdash; a fertile time for media to write a lot of words to get a lot of clicks without transmitting a shred of information.

[Grady Booch](https://www.google.com/search?q=grady+booch), chief scientist at IBM known for developing UML (I guess?), sparked a kerfuffle by asserting [Google's career certificate program](https://grow.google/certificates/) would create a [generation of disposable developers](https://twitter.com/Grady_Booch/status/1290550738867740674). The great esteemed such-and-such didn't even skim the program materials before his pronouncement as Google doesn't offer any kind of programming certificate, but who has the time to read words when there's smug gatekeepery to do! Anyway, a lot of people took umbrage &mdash; many adjacent to the cringey follow-your-dreams tech dude influencer [JavaGrifter](https://twitter.com/javagrifter) crowd &mdash; and torches and pitchforks were hoisted.

### open tabs

[The Hate-Fueled Rise of r/The_Donald—and Its Epic Takedown](https://www.wired.com/story/the-hate-fueled-rise-of-rthe-donald-and-its-epic-takedown/) [Wired] &mdash; "*'In the early days of The_Donald it was like, half troll users saying ridiculous things as if they were Donald Trump supporters, and half actual Donald Trump supporters,' Huffman says. 'I think if you’ve lived in America over the last four years, that’s actually not as far-fetched as it sounds. Not being able to distinguish between parody and satire and reality was actually a truth that we lived.'*"

[We Aren’t Holding The Right People Responsible For Cancel Culture](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/elaminabdelmahmoud/cancel-culture-free-speech-big-tech-facebook-twitter) [BuzzFeed News] &mdash; "*The Canadian media thinker Marshall McLuhan wrote at length about how mediums themselves influence how we think and act. Eventually, he argued, we start reacting less to new information delivered by a medium, and more to the rhythms of the medium itself. Boy, would he have hated \*gestures broadly\* this.*"

[How Vulnerable is G.P.S.?](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-vulnerable-is-gps) [The New Yorker] &mdash; "*The Hornet appeared, hovering forty feet above the missile range. Humphreys spoke a code word into his handheld radio: 'Lightning.' Up on the hill, his students switched on the spoofer. Convinced that it had drifted upward, the drone tried to correct, beginning a steep dive toward the desert floor. Just as it was about to crash into the ground, a manual operator grabbed the controls, pulling the Hornet out of its nosedive. Humphreys’s team let out a celebratory whoop over the radio.*"

### media

[Jack Dorsey on Twitter's Mistakes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/podcasts/the-daily/Jack-dorsey-twitter-trump.html) [The Daily] &mdash; The subject of a 17-year-old kid spear-phishing his way into the account administration system for their massively influential social network didn't come up. Seems like a major mistake &mdash; I dunno.

[Ta-dum! It's Netflix](https://www.20k.org/episodes/netflix) [Twenty Thousand Hertz] &mdash; 
Thanks to repetition and something ineffable, Netflix's sound logo is iconic. This episode explores the story of its composition told by the team that worked on it. "*One of the directions I would give is don't be afraid to be quirkier or different. An obvious one that comes to mind is the [HBO static](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyF27MyH1h0). That's like the most annoying sound. But, they've made it into a positive thing.*"

[X-Men Past, Present, and Future](https://www.theringer.com/2020/8/3/21353448/our-nostalgia-for-syndicated-television-plus-x-men-past-present-and-future-with-jason-concepcion) [The Watch] &mdash; The X-Men titles were always the more interesting books in the Marvel comics universe because they were slightly more mature thematically, insomuch as the [Comics Code Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics_Code_Authority#1954_Code_criteria) would allow. Now with [Jonathan Hickman](https://www.marvel.com/comics/creators/11743/jonathan_hickman) at the helm, they are as readable as ever. The hosts explore their relationship with X-Men throughout the years and discuss this latest incarnation. Also check out [The Incomparable's podcast](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/502/) on the [House of X / Powers of X](https://www.amazon.com/House-X-Powers-Jonathan-Hickman/dp/1302915703) miniseries which inaugurated this version, if you're into this kinda thing.

[Star Trek: Lower Decks](https://www.cbs.com/shows/star-trek-lower-decks) [CBS All Access] &mdash; An antipodal chaser to the recent bleak and (mostly) self-serious [Star Trek: Picard](https://www.cbs.com/shows/star-trek-picard/), Lower Decks is an animated series purportedly in the spirit of [Rick and Morty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty) and helmed by a former writer of that show. It's more [office sitcom](https://youtu.be/NuPolrd9yuo?t=35) than [hard sci-fi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w3PzTl9REo&feature=youtu.be&t=48) and while it delivers a handful of sensible chuckles in its debut episode, it doesn't escape its origins as an item on a list of brand extension ideas on a CBS conference room whiteboard: *'adult cartoon &mdash; funny??'*. That said, showrunner [Mike McMahan](https://twitter.com/MikeMcMahanTM) is responsible for one of the [all-time undefeated tweets](https://twitter.com/tng_s8/status/126804153438703616) as [@tng_s8](https://twitter.com/tng_s8), so let's give it some time, mkay?
